# Puzzle Constructor
Reconstructs Puzzle from constituent images using Computer Vision

## About
A Puzzle Constructor built on Google Colab to plot given puzzle images in the right order according to blue/red indicator dots present on the images.
This is my first project using computer vision to extract information from images. It's named Fumoffu.. because that was the provided puzzle image for this project.

## Technologies Used
- Python/Numpy/MatPlotLib
- OpenCV (cv2): Color Conversion, Edge Detection (Canny), Contours

Biggest challenge besides learning the basics of the above technologies ==> Learning how to upload/unzip/access/remove files on colab
